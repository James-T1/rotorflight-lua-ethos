# Rotorflight Lua Scripts for Ethos

## LUA script considerations

- Tested on Ethos 1.1.0-alpha16
- Probably only works on the X20 for now, X10 & X12 may need different layout templates
- a FrSky Smartport or F.Port receiver
- The screen layout and text sizes have not been optimized yet.

## Installation
Download the latest files (Click "Code" and then "Download ZIP") and copy the RF folder to the scripts folder on your transmitter. You will know if you did this correctly if the `RF` system widget shows up on the Ethos system menu.

### Copying the RF folder
